# HedgieGenerator - the cutest photo generator of hedgehogs ever
This project is my first actual React app. Also, I used TypeScript in there for the first time.
The launching of the web app is extremely simple:
- Download files from this repo
- Run ``npm install`` or if you like brevety ``npm i``
- Upon installing required packages do ``npm run dev`` command and follow the link, given in your terminal
- Enjoy!
